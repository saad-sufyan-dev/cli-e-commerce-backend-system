# CLI E-Commerce Backend System (Python)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a command-line based e-commerce backend system built in Python.
It simulates a real shopping experience where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and complete checkout operations.

The project is designed for learning and portfolio purposes, focusing on core software engineering principles.

## 🔗 Core Class Design

* **Product** → Represents an item in the store
* **CartItem** → Represents a product with quantity
* **Cart** → Manages cart items and calculations
* **Customer** → Holds user data and cart
* **Store** → Controls products, customers, and checkout process

## 💡 Concepts Practiced

* Classes and Objects
* Inheritance (optional extension)
* Composition (Cart → CartItems → Product)
* File Handling (read/write .txt data)
* Modular programming
* Basic system design thinking

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add JSON or database storage
* Add authentication system
* Add discount and coupon system
* Add order history tracking
* Convert into Flask/Django API version
